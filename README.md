# Lung-Cancer-Detection 

## Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. It accounted for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 alone. Of all the different possible types of Cancer, Lung Cancer was the most common cause of cancer death in 2020, accounting for about 1.80 million deaths.

Lung cancer occurs when cells of the lungs start dividing uncontrollably without dying off. This causes the growth of tumors which can reduce a personâ€™s ability to breathe and spread to other parts of the body.

In our project, we classify lung CT scans to identify whether the cases are Benign, Malignant, or Normal. We do this using a Convolutional Neural Network. 

## Project Implementation 

### SDLC approach: Waterfall Model 
The Waterfall Model is a sequential design process, often used in Software development processes; where progress is seen flowing steadily through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation, and Maintenance. 

In the waterfall model, we start with the feasibility study and move down through the various phases of Implementation, Testing, Deployment, maintenance, and into the live environment. This Model is also called the classic Life-Cycle model as it suggests a systematic sequential approach to software development. This is one of the oldest models followed in software
engineering. The process begins with the communication phase where the customer specifies the requirements and then progresses through other phases like planning, modeling, construction, and deployment of the software.
