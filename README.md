# Lung-Cancer-Detection
It contains the code we have used for building our CNN model using GoogLeNet architecture.
We used convolutional neural network (CNN)) with GoogLeNet architecture. 
Using this architecture, it reduced the number of operations and helped in improving the training time of the model. 
The accuracy of the model is 93.7%
